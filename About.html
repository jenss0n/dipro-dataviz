          <h3>OECD South East Europe Regional Programme</h3>
          <p>
            Since 2000, the OECD South East Europe Regional Programme (SEERP)
            has been providing the region’s economies with comprehensive policy
            analysis and advice to boost sustainable and inclusive economic
            growth, and to facilitate the region’s socio-economic convergence
            with the OECD and European Union (EU). Using OECD methods, tools and
            standards, the SEERP has provided regular analytical assessments and
            policy recommendations to bolster competitiveness and regional
            integration, in close alignment with the region’s EU agenda. It also
            acts as the central entry point for the Western Balkans to tap into
            diverse policy advice from the OECD by facilitating engagement with
            OECD bodies and fostering co-operation between OECD members and
            regional stakeholders, including policy makers, business leaders and
            civil society. The SEERP uses a blend of data collection,
            comprehensive analysis, formulation of policy recommendations,
            exchange of best practices, public and private stakeholder dialogue,
            and capacity building to support policy making and reforms in the
            region. Its analytical products have become key reference documents
            informing policy-making processes. Its impact is underscored by
            several significant achievements, including its role in informing
            economic reform agendas. It has served as a vital analytical
            resource for processes such as EU accession and regional platforms
            such as the Berlin Process and the South East European Co-operation
            Process (SEECP). The programme also enhances regional co-operation
            and dialogue among peers and OECD member countries on cross-cutting
            policy issues. SEERP work areas include: Bolstering economic reforms
            and convergence through the Western Balkans Competitiveness Outlook
            2024 and the Economic Convergence scoreboard. Strengthening private
            sector development through the Small Business Act Assessment SME
            Policy Index for the Western Balkans and Türkiye. Supporting the
            green and digital transition in the Western Balkans. Promoting
            fairness and fostering business integrity through the Fair Market
            Conditions for Competitiveness project.

          <h3>
            Western Balkans Competitiveness Outlook: A tool for monitoring
            progress in building competitive economies
          </h3>
          <p>
            Funded by the European Union, the flagship regional publication
            series, the Western Balkans Competitiveness Outlook, is the most
            comprehensive assessment of economic reforms in the six Western
            Balkan economies: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*,
            Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. Since 2016 it has provided
            the region’s policy makers with a unique benchmarking tool, enabling
            them to compare economic policy performance over time and to design
            future policies based on robust evidence and actionable policy
            recommendations from OECD standards and good practices. The
            Competitiveness Outlook employs a participatory assessment method
            (see the Methodology section for more detailed information) aimed at
            fostering peer learning, consensus building on reform priorities and
            stakeholder co-ordination. This inclusive approach is reflected in
            the diverse stakeholders involved in assessment activities and
            contributes to robust data collection and facilitates constructive
            exchanges on concrete policy issues among stakeholders and with the
            OECD.

          <h3>Western Balkans Competitiveness Outlook 2024</h3>
          <p>
            The fourth edition of the Western Balkans Competitiveness Outlook
            2024 covers 15 policy areas and introduces a novel approach that
            harnesses complementarities between these areas by organising
            findings into five policy clusters: 1) Infrastructure and
            connectivity; 2) Skills; 3) Business environment; 4) Digital
            Transformation; and 5) Greening. Assessment results are presented in
            distinct profiles for each Western Balkan economy that provide an
            economy-specific analysis of the 15 policy areas, providing
            actionable recommendations within each area for enhanced
            competitiveness. The regional profile offers insights into policy
            progress and challenges across the five clusters, monitoring the
            region’s convergence towards OECD and EU standards. These reports
            complement the Data Hub, which was prepared for the first time for
            this fourth edition and is designed to showcase the progress of
            individual economies and the region over time, enhancing the
            visualisation, accessibility and dissemination of the assessment
            results. Over time, the Data Hub is expected to integrate findings
            and results from other key OECD work streams to provide a
            comprehensive view of the region’s policy landscape in support of
            competitiveness.
